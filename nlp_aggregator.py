"""nlp_aggregator.py — stubbed during repository cleanup.

This file previously contained an optional NLP aggregation scaffold. The code
was moved/archived and replaced with this harmless stub to avoid import-time
network calls and accidental execution in production/test runs.

If you need the original implementation, see the archive or legacy folders.
