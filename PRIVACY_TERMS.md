Short privacy & terms notice (use this in-app or on your site)

Terms & Privacy (short)

By using this app you acknowledge and agree to the following:

1. Data & API usage
- This app fetches third-party market, news, and analyst data using API keys owned by the app owner. The app owner is responsible for API usage and billing for those keys.
- Requests you make through this app will be proxied by the app owner to third-party providers. The app owner may log metadata about requests (timestamp, endpoint, and approximate usage) for monitoring and cost control.

2. Personal Data & Logging
- The app minimizes collection of personal data. The app may store non-identifying metadata about usage (e.g., which ticker you requested and when) to support caching, rate-limiting, and debugging.
- Sensitive personal data (passwords, payment details) should not be entered into this app.

3. Access & Acceptable Use
- This app is intended for a small, invited user group only. You agree not to share access credentials or invite links outside the invited group.
- Abuse (excessive automated scraping, attempts to extract API keys, or other misuse) may result in access revocation.

4. Security & Key Handling
- API keys are stored securely by the app owner and not shared with users.
- If you suspect misuse of your interaction data or a security incident, contact the app owner immediately.

5. Liability
- The data and recommendations provided are for informational purposes only. The app owner and contributors are not financial advisors and are not responsible for any trading decisions or losses.

Consent
- By using the deployed app, you acknowledge you have read and agree to these terms.

Customization
- Edit company name, contact email, and retention periods before showing this to users. Keep it visible in the app footer or onboarding modal.
