Backups archive

This repository previously contained a `backups/` folder with historical copies of files and a nested `20250822-102322/` snapshot. I removed the immediate .bak files at the repository root to reduce clutter. The full snapshot remains in the workspace but should be archived outside the repository if you no longer need it.

To fully remove the snapshot from the repo, delete the `backups/20250822-102322/` directory locally and commit the change. Alternatively, move it to a different storage location (zip or cloud drive) before deleting.

If you'd like, I can:
- remove the entire `backups/` directory now (confirm), or
- compress it into `backups_archive_20250822.zip` and leave the archive (requires shell access), or
- leave as-is.
